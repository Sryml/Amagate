# Amagate Documentation

## üìñ Installation

Blender version: 4.3.0 or above

From the menu bar, select `Edit -> Preferences -> Get Extensions`,  
then click `Install from Disk` in the top-right corner and choose the downloaded extension zip file.

Upon first installation, the required Python packages (approximately 41MB) will be automatically installed.

## üå† Features

- [Level Editor (L3D)](#level-editor-l3d)
- Blade coordinate conversion
- Cubemap conversion

## Level Editor (L3D)

### ‚ú® Advantages

- Uses a custom binary protocol to communicate with the game client (e.g., synchronizing camera movement, loading maps, etc.)
- Freely editable surfaces (e.g., creating arched walls)
- Moving sectors does not lose slope states like in LED
- Can divide sub-textures of any shape on any plane of a sector (LED can only be divided vertically on walls)
- Texture dropdown with filtering and preview functionality
- Individual texture scaling for X/Y axes
- Real-time sky texture switching
- Real-time 3D preview and editing

### üéØ Marker Objects

- `Player` indicates the player's position when exporting the map

### HUD Information

1. Selected sector
2. Whether it is homeomorphic to a 2D sphere  
   If mixed types exist in the selected sector, it displays as `*`
3. Whether it is a convex polyhedron  
   If mixed types exist in the selected sector, it displays as `*`

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes

- **Volumetric Fog**  
  Black fog cannot display lights
- **Concave Polyhedrons**  
  Do not create complex concave sectors at once; instead, create multiple convex sectors and then connect them
- **Non-uniform scaling issues**  
  If sector connection or other sector operations fail, try applying scale transformation `(Ctrl+A -> Scale)`
- **Light simulation deviation**  
  Occurs in bulb light ranges or multi-light brightness/color
- **Sky textures**  
  Sky texture must occupy a sector plane exclusively
- **Preventing automatic dissolve**  
  To set different positions/scaling/angles for the same texture on a flat surface, mark the edges as sharp
- **Copy handling**  
  Use `Shift+D/Alt+D` for sector duplication instead of `Ctrl+C`
- **Sector connection**  
  If sector connection fails, try repositioning to ensure surfaces are tightly aligned
- **Separating convex parts**  
  Complex concave polyhedrons cannot be separated automatically and must be separated manually.  
  Perform `Split Concave Faces` first before separation, otherwise the resulting sectors may contain concave polyhedrons.  
  Cross-surface splitting is unreliable; recommend disabling auto-connect and manually adjusting split sectors before perform the connection

## üìù Todo

- BOD item placement
